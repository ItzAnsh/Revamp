						<h2>Leadership Skills</h2>

						<p class="a">
							Leadership is about more than authority and being in charge. In
							fact, a successful leader doesn’t even need to have an official
							title.This is because a title doesn’t automatically mean you’re a
							leader — especially a good one. And, not having a title doesn’t
							mean that you can’t be a leader.Effective leadership isn’t about
							ordering people around. It’s about being a source of empowerment
							for others, so they can achieve success for themselves and for the
							organization.

						<h2>Communication Skills</h2>
						<p>
							Being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most
							important of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass
							information to other people, and to understand what is said to us.
							You only have to watch a baby listening intently to its mother and
							trying to repeat the sounds that she makes to understand how
							fundamental is the urge to communicate.
							<br />
							Communication, at its simplest, is the act of transferring
							information from one place to another. It may be vocally (using
							voice), written (using printed or digital media such as books,
							magazines, websites or emails), visually (using logos, maps,
							charts or graphs) or non-verbally (using body language, gestures
							and the tone and pitch of voice). In practice, it is often a
							combination of several of these.

						<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
						<p>
							Technical skills are qualities acquired by using and gaining
							expertise in performing physical or digital tasks. There are many
							different kinds of technical skills. Traditionally, people working
							in mathematics, computer science, mechanics and information
							technology have used many technical skills. Today, however, many
							more industries rely on employees with technical knowledge. For
							example, retail and food service workers often need to know how to
							use point-of-sale (POS) software.

						<h2>Physical Skills</h2>

						<p>
							The functionality of your fitness isn’t determined by a single
							exercise or skill. Instead, it’s made up of several physical
							skills – ten to be exact.<br /><br />

							These ten general physical skills come together to prepare you for
							almost any physical activity. Working on the following skills
							provides you with a level of fitness that is well-balanced and
							avoids specializing.

					<h2>Presentation Skills</h2>
					<p>
						A presentation is a means of communication that can be adapted to
						various speaking situations, such as talking to a group, addressing
						a meeting or briefing a team. <br /><br />

						A presentation can also be used as a broad term that encompasses
						other ‘speaking engagements’ such as making a speech at a wedding,
						or getting a point across in a video conference. <br /><br />

						To be effective, step-by-step preparation and the method and means
						of presenting the information should be carefully considered.
