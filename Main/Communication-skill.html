						Being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most important
						of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass information to ot
						her people, and to understand what is said to us. You only have to
						watch a baby listening intently to its mother and trying to repeat
						the sounds that she makes to understand how fundamental is the urge
						to communicate.

						Communication, at its simplest, is the act of transferring
						information from one place to another. It may be vocally (using
						voice), written (using printed or digital media such as books,
						magazines, websites or emails), visually (using logos, maps, charts
						or graphs) or non-verbally (using body language, gestures and the
						tone and pitch of voice). In practice, it is often a combination of
						several of these.

				<strong>WAYS TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS:</strong>

			<div class="container-fluid">
				<div class="row">
					<ol type="1" class="j m-3">
						<li>
							<strong>Practice active listening:</strong>
							<span class="k">
								Effective communicators are always good listeners. Active
								listening means engaging with what people say by giving
								affirmative replies and asking followup questions to show that
								you are paying attention.</span
							>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Focus on nonverbal communication:</strong>
							<span class="k">
								Mastering nonverbal cues and nonverbal signals can help prevent
								miscommunication and signal interest to those around you. Pay
								attention to your facial expressions and body language when you
								are speaking with someone in a professional setting.</span
							>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Manage your own emotions:</strong
							><span class="k">
								For the sake of clear communication and your own personal
								wellbeing, it’s important to manage your emotions and express
								them appropriately in context.</span
							>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Practice public speaking:</strong
							><span class="k">
								Public speaking may sound daunting, but there’s no better way to
								develop good communication skills than by seeking out public
								speaking opportunities. Great communicators are able to clearly
								articulate their feelings, whether they’re speaking to a large
								group or talking face-to-face to one other person.</span
