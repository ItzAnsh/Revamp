			<ol class="">
				<ol data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="2000" style="font-size: 20px">
					<span class="e">Set Goals:</span
					><br />
					Ask yourself what you want to achieve with your presentation and how
					it's going to benefit your audience. Do you want to use it to share
					information with others? Is it meant to update your audience or inform
					them about some important news or decisions? Try to make sure you know
					what your objectives are,and make sure your presentation achieves them
					clearly.
				</ol>
				<br />
				<ol data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="2000" style="font-size: 20px">
					<span class="e">Show some passion:</span
					><br />
					Your audience is more likely to be engaged with what you're saying if
					you can speak about it with passion and conviction. If you truly care
					about your presentation's subject matter, your enthusiasm will shine
					through.Not only that, but speaking with passion can help to overcome
					nervousness because you'll be so absorbed in what you're saying, you
					won't have time to worry about how you're being received.
				</ol>
				<br />
				<ol data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="2000" style="font-size: 20px">
					<span class="e">Use personal stories:</span
					><br />
					Good public speakers know how important storytelling is for a
					successful presentation. But talking about yourself, such as including
					personal anecdotes to illustrate the points you're trying to make, can
					be even more powerful.
				</ol>
				<br />
				<ol data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="2000" style="font-size: 20px">
					<span class="e">Practise - then practise again:</span
					><br />
					If you have time, practise your presentation as often as possible.
					Rehearse to the point that you're so familiar with your subject
					matter, you could deliver your presentation with ease - like having a
					conversation with a friend. Also try to do at least one practise run
					in front of a friend or family member.
