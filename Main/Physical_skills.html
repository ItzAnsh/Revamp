					Physical skills are the accuracy and consistency of how we use our bodies when performing tasks. We use our physical skills in day-to-day activities such as walking, but they come in handy when we do particularly active things such as sports, dancing, and drama.We begin to learn physical skills from birth. At a younger age, physical skills are more commonly known as fine and gross motor skills.These types of physical skills are perfected through tasks such as colouring, as children use the grip of their fingers to hold pens and pencils.
